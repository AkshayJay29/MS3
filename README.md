# Battleships

## Introduction

Welcome to my third project. This project is a simple battleships game that uses the python programming language, which runs in the terminal on Heroku.

The user will try to beat the CPU by finding all the battleships first. Each battleship is in a 1x1 spot on the board.

A live version of the game can be found [here](placeholder).
